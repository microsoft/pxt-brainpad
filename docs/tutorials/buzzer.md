## Step 1

Let's start by doing something simple. Let's Light up the LED on your BrainPad. You'll notice the project begins with a
``|loops:forever|``block.



## Step 2

This means any of the blocks you place inside the ``||loops:forever||``block keep looping...forever.

## Step 3

Lets drag a new block into the ``||loops:forever||``block. Under Light Bulb, drag in the ``||lightbulb:set light bulb to||`` block. 


```block
lightbulb.setColor(0xFF0000)



```
