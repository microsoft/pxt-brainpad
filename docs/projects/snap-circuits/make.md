## Duration: ~20 minutes

## Materials
  * Elenco Snap Circuits Kit (we used [Model: SC300](https://www.elenco.com/brand/snap-circuits/ "Elenco website"))
  * BrainPad ([www.brainpad.com](https://www.brainpad.com "BrainPad website")) 
  * 3 - 6 inch Wires with Aligator Clips

## Step 1: Base Grid

First, place the Base Grid (#6SCBG) onto a flat surface. We will connect all the components to this base. 

![Step 1](/static/cp/projects/snap-circuits/step1.jpg)

## Step 2: Mount the BrainPad to the Base Grid

Next, we will mount the BrainPad to our Base Grid. Place the BrainPad on the 2nd Row at the 5th Hexigon, as pictured.

## Step 3: Add the Motor for our Fan

Find the M1 Motor Module (#6SCM1). Attach the module to the Base Grid on the 5th snap at the top of the grid, as pictured.

## Step 4: Add the battery holder

Next, we'll add a Battery Holder - B1 (#6SCL1) to power our the BrainPad and our Snap Circuit. Place the first Battery Module on the 5th row/5th column of the Base Grid.

## Step 5: Connect a 2nd battery holder

Snap in the 2nd battery pack on the same 5th Row next to the other battery pack on the 8th column, as pictured.

## Step 6: Connect 5-Snap Wire

Now we will connect our first 5-Snap Wire (#6SC05) labelled '5' to our circuit. We will also need a 1-Snap Wire (#6SC01) spacer labelled '1'. Snap in the spacer at the top right cornor of the Base Grid. Next connect the 5-Snap Wire to the spacer and the top left snap of our 2nd Battery holder as shown in the picture.

## Step 7: Connect 4-Snap Wire

Next, we will connect a 4-Snap Wire (#6SC04) labelled '4' to our circuit. First place another 1-Snap spacer on the right side of our Motor module - M1. Next snap the 4-Snap Wire onto the spacer we just added to the M1 module. Connect the other end to the 5-Snap Wire we placed in the previous step. Connecting the the two Snap Wires together.

## Step 8: Connect Battery Holders

Now we will use a 2-Snap Wire (#6SC02) labelled '2' and connect both Battery Holders together as shown below. 

![Step 8](/static/cp/projects/snap-circuits/step8.jpg)

## Step 9: Connect a Transistor

Next we will place the NPN Transistor Q2 (#6SCQ2) We can place it in the 4th row and 3rd column. Place in the direction shown in image below.   

![Step 9](/static/cp/projects/snap-circuits/step9.jpg)

## Step 10: Connect 2-Snap Wire

Snap in a 2-Snap Wire (#6SC02) labelled '2' to left side of the 'M1' Motor Module. Also add a 1-Snap spacer to the bottom of the 2-Snap Wire. As shown below. We will leave the other end unconnected for the moment. 

![Step 10](/static/cp/projects/snap-circuits/step10.jpg)

## Step 11: Connect 3-Snap Wire

Next we will connect a 3-Snap Wire (#6SC03) labelled '3' to the 2-Snap Wire we just placed, then connect a 1-Snap spacer to the other end of the 3-Snap Wire. Connect it to the top of the Transistor Module 'Q2'.

![Step 11](/static/cp/projects/snap-circuits/step11.jpg)

## Step 12: Connect the Resistor Module

Connect the Resistor Module (#6SCR1) labelled 'R1' to the far left snap on our Transistor Module 'Q2'. As demonstrated in the image below. 

![Step 12](/static/cp/projects/snap-circuits/step12.jpg)


## Step 13: Connect 2-Snap Wire

Connect a 2-Snap Wire (#6SC02) labelled '2' to the bottom snap on our Transistor Module 'Q2'. As demonstrated in the image below. Connect the other end to the nearby battery module. 

![Step 13](/static/cp/projects/snap-circuits/step13.jpg)

## Step 14: Connect a wire to the BrainPad Expansion header

Find a wire with an Aligator clip on one side and a bare wire on the other end. 
Connect the bare wire end into the 'AN' pin of the left side of the BrainPad's expansion header.  

![Step 14](/static/cp/projects/snap-circuits/step14.jpg)

## Step 15: Connect the Wire to Resistor

Connect the Aligator clip end of our wire to the end of the 'R2' Resistor modules, as shown below. 

![Step 15](/static/cp/projects/snap-circuits/step15.jpg)

## Step 16: Connect Ground Wire to 2-Snap Wire

Connect the 2nd Aligator clipped bare wire to Ground (GND) pin on the left BrainPad's expansion header. Then connect to the 2-Snap Wire that is connected at the bottom of the NPN Transistor module 'Q2', the 2-Snap Wire, that is connected to the left battery module. 

![Step 16](/static/cp/projects/snap-circuits/step16.jpg)

## Step 17: Connect a wire from the BrainPad Expansion header

Connect our 3rd Aligator clipped bare wire to the 5V pin on the right side of the BrainPad's expansion slot, connect the clip end to the far right Snap on the right battery module.
